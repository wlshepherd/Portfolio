# Computer Science Graduate Portfolio :page_facing_up:

## Description:
Hello! I'm William, a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Cyber Security and Technology from Cardiff University. I have a passion for technology, with interests spanning cyber security, machine learning, computer graphics, and web application development. This portfolio showcases a selection of my personal projects, highlighting my skills and experience.

## Projects: :file_folder:

**Cyber Security :lock::**
* [**Detecting Phishing Emails with Machine Learning (Python)**](https://github.com/wlshepherd/My_Portfolio/blob/main/PhishingDetection.ipynb)
* Penetration Test Report of Metasploitable 2.0 (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)

**Web Application Design & Development :computer::**
* [**Responsive Photography Portfolio (JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS)**](https://wlshepherd.github.io/react-first-project/)
     * This simple front-end project was my first using the React framework, and it involved designing and developing a responsive photography portfolio. The process began with sketching out initial ideas on paper, allowing me to brainstorm layout options and visualize the overall structure of the site. After finalizing the sketches, I transitioned to Figma, a powerful design tool that enabled me to create high-fidelity mockups. Once the design was finalized, I began implementing it using React. The portfolio features:
       * A dynamic image gallery with zoom functionality.
       * Basic transitions and animations to furthermore enhance the user's experience (with the react-spring library).
       * Custom CSS styling for a consistent color palette and typography which helped to create a professional look and feel.
         
* Crypto Shark: Real-Time Cryptocurrency Dashboard (TypeScript, React, HTML, SCSS)
    * The goal of this project was to to construct a robust and visually appealing web application UI for tracking market trends and for a crypto wallet. This project served as a challenging learning experience, allowing me to deepen my understanding of React and explore the benefits of TypeScript. Components include the following:
        * Dynamically updated area bar charts that visualize the performance of selected cryptocurrencies (utilising the d3.js library).
        * Employed the CoinGecko API to retrieve historical and current cryptocurrency performance data and the most recent trending cryptocurrencies, utilizing Axios for the HTTP requests.

* Phantom: Privacy-Based Social Media Platform (Python, Django, TypeScript, React, HTML5, Tailwind CSS, MySQL)
    * This ongoing full-stack development project, codenamed 'Phantom,' aims to create a privacy-focused social media platform inspired by X, Instagram, and Mastodon. Drawing upon the skills and knowledge acquired from previous projects, Phantom will enable users to establish anonymous accounts, allowing them to post updates, engage in discussions through comments, and exchange messages with other users. A paramount focus of this project is the robust implementation of cybersecurity measures to safeguard user data and ensure the platform's integrity.

**Miscellaneous :warning::**
* [**National Football League Season Simulator (Java)**](https://github.com/wlshepherd/NFL-J-Project/tree/master/src)
    * This project marks my introduction into the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming. This application allows users to simulate an entire NFL season, providing an engaging way to explore game outcomes based on the latest Madden NFL team ratings of the 2024/2025 season. The game mechanics favour the major teams including the Kansas City Chiefs, Detroit Lions, however every so often a weaker team such as the Las Vegas Raiders and the Carolina Panthers are able to pull off an upset victory making the season simulations fairly realistic. This code moreover includes a playoff and Super Bowl system, allowing users to experience the excitement of postseason play. After the regular season concludes, the top teams are seeded based on their performance, leading to a series of elimination rounds that culminate in the championship game.

## Academic Qualifications :school::
