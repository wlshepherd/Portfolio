# My Portfolio :page_facing_up:

## Description:
Hello! I'm William, currently a Junior DevSecOps Engineer at esure Group. I have a passion for technology, with interests spanning ethical hacking, digital privacy and front-end development. This portfolio showcases a selection of my personal projects, highlighting my skills and experience.

## Projects: :file_folder:

**Cyber Security:** :lock:
 * Pseudo Spyware Challenge
    * Technologies Involved: Python 3.13, Tor, Wireshark
    * A post-exploitation simulation script built in Python, designed to emulate basic spyware behavior within a controlled, ethical lab environment. Operating on a client-server model, the script demonstrates how compromised systems can exfiltrate data — such as system info, clipboard contents, or file listings — to a remote listener. This project serves as a hands-on exploration of attacker methodologies, helping defenders understand the mechanics of data leakage, persistence, and covert communication.
  
 * 'Natty Narwhal' Operating System Penetration Test
    * Technologies Involved: Kali Linux, Ubuntu 11.04, Wireshark, PTES


**Full-Stack Development:** :computer:
* Phantom: Dark Web Social Media Platform
    * Technologies Involved: Java, Spring Boot, TypeScript, React, HTML5, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, Tor, Figma
    * This ongoing full-stack development project, codenamed 'Phantom,' aims to create a privacy-focused social media platform web-application which is inspired by X, Instagram, and Mastodon. Drawing upon the skills and knowledge acquired from previous projects alongside my academic modules, Phantom will enable users to establish anonymous accounts, allowing them to post updates, engage in discussions through comments, and exchange messages with other users. A paramount focus of this project is the robust implementation of cybersecurity measures to safeguard user data and ensure the platform's integrity. Phantom reimagines online interaction through a lens of cybersecurity, decentralization, and ethical design.
